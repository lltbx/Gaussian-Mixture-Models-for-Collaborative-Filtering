# Gaussian-Mixture-Models-for-Collaborative-Filtering
This project implements a collaborative filtering system using Gaussian mixture models to predict movie ratings from a partially filled user-movie rating matrix, derived from a large Netflix dataset. Each userâ€™s rating profile is modeled as a sample from a mixture of Gaussians, where users are softly assigned to one of several user types. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is employed to estimate the model parameters by iterating between assigning users to types and updating the Gaussian distributions for each type. Once trained, the model predicts missing ratings to complete the matrix.
